        <h1>Stress Relief</h1>
        <p>
          We all encounter stress at one time or another. So it's important to be able
          to recognize stress and learn how to deal with it.
        </p>

        <h2>What is stress?</h2>

        <p>
          Stress is the feeling that people have when they are overloaded
          and struggling to cope with demands. Anything that poses a real
          or perceived challenge or threat to a person's well-being can cause stress.
        </p>
        <p>
          Stress can also be a motivator. It can be essential to survival.
          The "fight-or-flight" mechanism helps us know when and how to
          respond to danger. But when this mechanism is triggered too easily,
          or when there are too many stressors at one time, it can become
          harmful to a person's mental and physical health.
        </p>
