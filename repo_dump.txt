"""
repo_to_text.py

A command-line tool that converts the contents of a Git repository
into a textual format, preserving structure and file contents.

Usage:
    python repo_to_text.py --repo <path_to_repo> [--output <output_file>] [--max-size <bytes>] [--skip-binary]

Arguments:
    --repo <path>         Path to the local Git repository.
    --output <file>       Optional path to output file (prints to stdout if not specified).
    --max-size <bytes>    Maximum file size in bytes to include in text output (default: 1 MB).
    --skip-binary         If specified, the script will skip binary files entirely.
    -h, --help            Show this help message.

Example:
    python repo_to_text.py --repo /path/to/my-repo --output repo_dump.txt

Notes:
    1. By default, the .git directory is excluded.
    2. The script will attempt a simple binary check if --skip-binary is provided.
    3. --max-size can be used to limit the dumping of extremely large files.
       Files above this threshold will be noted, but their contents will not be included.

        <p>
          Tired of being tired? Strength training can help you manage or lose weight 
          and increase your metabolism to help you burn more calories. It can also

        <h3 class="underline">Get your heart rate up</h3>
        <p>
          Want to lose weight? Cardiovascular exercise burns calories and improves overall health.
          It can reduce belly fat, promote brain growth, prevent stress, and help you focus.
        </p>

        <h3 class="underline">Relax</h3>
        <p>
          Stressed out? Stress can weaken the immune system and cause high blood pressure, 
          fatigue, depression, anxiety, and even heart disease. Learn ways to manage and reduce stress.
        </p>

        <h3 class="underline">Eat what's right for you</h3>
        <p>
          Are you really what you eat? Lose weight, gain weight, or just feel great! Maintaining
          a healthy diet is probably the most important thing you can do to promote overall health.

        <h2>How to prepare to Shape Up!</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Get a check up</strong><br>
          If you have any health issues or take any medications, be sure to consult 
          with your healthcare provider before beginning a new exercise or diet regimen.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Dress for Success</strong><br>
          Workout clothes should be comfy. While exercising, you should be thinking about 
          what you're doing, not what you're wearing. That includes good shoes, which are 
          essential for running, jogging, or walking, and socks that absorb shock and sweat.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Equipment?</strong><br>
          You don't need to buy a lot of fancy equipment to get in shape. But you might 
          want to invest in a yoga mat, a large exercise ball, or some weights, depending 
          on your Shape Up! plan.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Resist Temptation</strong><br>
          It's hard to eat right when everyone else is buying lunch at a fast food 
          restaurant. Invest in some good food containers and bring your healthy lunch 
          and snacks. Your body and your wallet will thank you.

          As fitness expert Amanda Russell said:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          Fitness is about so much more than exercise. 
          It's a catalyst for positive change, and it affects every aspect of your life.
        </blockquote>

        <h2>What we offer</h2>

        <h3 class="underline">Build strong muscles</h3>
        <p>
          Tired of being tired? Strength training can help you manage or lose weight 
          and increase your metabolism to help you burn more calories. It can also 
          increase bone density and reduce the risk of osteoporosis.
        </p>

        <h3 class="underline">Get your heart rate up</h3>
        <p>
          Want to lose weight? Cardiovascular exercise burns calories and improves overall health.
          It can reduce belly fat, promote brain growth, prevent stress, and help you focus.
        </p>

        <h3 class="underline">Relax</h3>
        <p>
          Stressed out? Stress can weaken the immune system and cause high blood pressure, 
          fatigue, depression, anxiety, and even heart disease. Learn ways to manage and reduce stress.
        </p>

        <h3 class="underline">Eat what's right for you</h3>
        <p>
          Are you really what you eat? Lose weight, gain weight, or just feel great! Maintaining
          a healthy diet is probably the most important thing you can do to promote overall health.
        </p>

Why a healthy diet is important

Although exercise can help you lose body fat and tone muscles, it's also important to have a healthy diet. In the short term, a poor diet can contribute to stress, tiredness, and the capacity to work. Over time, it may add to the risk of developing some illnesses and health problems such as obesity, tooth decay, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, heart disease, some cancers, depression, osteoporosis, and type-2 diabetes. You've probably heard the old saying, "you are what you eat." So, to be in shape, you need to eat right.

What is a healthy diet?

A healthy diet is more than eating a salad for lunch or buying fat-free yogurt. A healthy diet is a balanced diet that gives your body the nutrients it needs to function properly. And that means getting the majority of your daily calories from fresh fruits and vegetables, whole grains, legumes, nuts, and lean proteins.

When should you start?

Right now! No matter how old you are, how you've eaten in the past, whether you exercise daily or almost never, the benefits of a healthy diet begin today... if you start today!

Where can you find healthy food?

Healthy food is available almost everywhere. You just have to plan ahead. Almost all restaurants and grocery stores offer healthy options nowadays. And, although it may be more expensive than unhealthy food, the extra money you spend on buying healthy food will be repaid many times over from a healthy life.

What is Meditation?

Meditation is one path toward transforming the mind. Buddhist meditation practices encourage and develop concentration, clarity, and emotional positivity.

Meditation offers you a way to cultivate new and more positive ways to approach the things you do throughout your day. Meditation can have a transformative effect and can lead to positive changes as well as a new understanding of life.

How to prepare to Shape Up!

Get a check up
If you have any health issues or take any medications, be sure to consult with your healthcare provider before beginning a new exercise or diet regimen.

Dress for Success
Workout clothes should be comfy. While exercising, you should be thinking about what you're doing, not what you're wearing. That includes good shoes, which are essential for running, jogging, or walking, and socks that absorb shock and sweat.

Equipment?
You don't need to buy a lot of fancy equipment to get in shape. But you might want to invest in a yoga mat, a large exercise ball, or some weights, depending on your Shape Up! plan.

Resist Temptation
It's hard to eat right when everyone else is buying lunch at a fast food restaurant. Invest in some good food containers and bring your healthy lunch and snacks. Your body and your wallet will thank you.

Strength training

Strength training is a type of physical exercise that uses resistance to induce muscular contraction. This builds the strength, anaerobic endurance, and size of skeletal muscles.

Benefits

When properly performed, strength training can provide significant functional benefits and improvement in overall health and well-being. Some of the benefits are:

increased bone, muscle, tendon, and ligament strength and toughness
improved joint function
reduced potential for injury
increased bone density
increased metabolism
improved cardiac function

Exercises and sports

Training commonly uses the technique of progressively increasing the force output of the muscle through incremental weight increases. It uses a variety of exercises and types of equipment to target specific muscle groups.
Some sports where strength training is central are bodybuilding, weightlifting, shotput, discus throw, and javelin throw. Many other sports use strength training as part of their training regimen. These include tennis, American football, wrestling, track and field, rowing, lacrosse, basketball, hockey, wrestling, and soccer.

Stress Relief
		
We all encounter stress at one time or another. So it's important to be able to recognize stress and learn how to deal with it.

What is stress?

Stress is the feeling that people have when they are overloaded and struggling to cope with demands. Anything that poses a real or perceived challenge or threat to a person's well-being can cause stress.

Stress can also be a motivator. It can be essential to survival. The &quot;fight-or-flight&quot; mechanism helps us know when and how to respond to danger. But when this mechanism is triggered too easily, or when there are too many stressors at one time, it can become harmful to a person's mental and physical health.

How to manage your stress

To help manage stress, try the following:

Take a break from what you're doing
Exercise on a regular basis
Take time to smile and laugh
Get support from family and friends
Meditate

Stress relief tips

Here are five tips that can help you relieve stress on a daily basis.
            
Take a break from what you're doing

Maybe it's hard to get away from a big work project, a crying baby or a growing credit card bill. But give yourself permission to step away from it for a short time. Don't avoid your stressors (those bills have to be paid sometime), but take a few minutes for yourself.
            
Exercise on a regular basis

Exercise is a huge part of being healthy, and it benefits your mind as well as your body. It doesn't have to be an hour a day; even a 20-minute walk in the midst of a stressful time can give you an immediate effect that can last for several hours.

Take time to smile and laugh

When people are stressed, they often hold a lot of the stress in their face. Laughs and smiles can help relieve some of that tension and improve the situation. And if you share your smile with someone else, it will them release some of their tension too!

Get support from family and friends

Call a friend, send an email. Sharing your concerns does help relieve stress. But pick a person who you feel can understand you. If your co-workers are the stressors, it probably won't alleviate your stress if you share your worries over credit card bills with one of them.

Meditate

Meditation helps the mind and body to relax and focus. When meditating, people can release emotions that may have been causing the body physical stress. Research has shown that even meditating briefly can reap immediate benefits.

Mindfulness: The practice of vipassana

Vipassana is a quality of mind generally referred to as mindfulness. Mindfulness is a state of open and nonjudgmental attention to the contents of consciousness. Cultivating this quality of mind has been shown to moderate pain, relieve anxiety and depression, improve cognitive function.

It may sound easy to sit quietly and remove your mind of distraction, but when you begin practicing vipassana, you'll find that distraction is the normal condition of the mind. In today�s fast-paced world, it's harder than ever to train the mind to break through these continuous distractions. Meditation is a technique for doing just this. The goal is to enjoy a mind that is undisturbed by worry and to become effortlessly aware of the flow of experience in the present.

There is no time limit on meditation. You can start with a 5-minute meditation session once a month, spend an hour a day meditating, or anything in between. This is your practice, your journey, and you proceed at your pace. Regardless of how long or how often you practice vipassana, you will always receive its benefits.

How to begin practicing vipassana

Sit comfortably, with your spine erect, either in a chair or cross-legged on a cushion.
Close your eyes, take a few deep breaths, and feel the points of contact between your body and the chair or floor. Notice the sensations associated with sitting, such as feelings of pressure, warmth, tingling, or vibration.
Gradually become aware of the process of breathing. Pay attention to wherever you feel the breath most clearly�either at the nostrils or in the rising and falling your abdomen.
Allow your attention to rest in the mere sensation of breathing. Don�t try to control your breath. Just let it come and go naturally.
Every time your mind wanders in thought, gently return it to the sensation of breathing.
As you focus on your breathing, you will notice that other perceptions and sensations continue to appear: sounds, feelings in the body, emotions. Notice these phenomena as they come into your field of awareness, and then return to the sensation of breathing.
The moment you realize that you have been lost in thought, notice the present thought itself as an object of consciousness. Then return your attention to your breathing or to whatever sounds or sensations arise in the next moment.
Continue in this way until you can simply witness all objects of consciousness�sights, sounds, sensations, emotions, and even thoughts themselves�as they arise and pass away.

Why a healthy diet is important

Although exercise can help you lose body fat and tone muscles, it's also important to have a healthy diet. In the short term, a poor diet can contribute to stress, tiredness, and the capacity to work. Over time, it may add to the risk of developing some illnesses and health problems such as obesity, tooth decay, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, heart disease, some cancers, depression, osteoporosis, and type-2 diabetes. You've probably heard the old saying, "you are what you eat." So, to be in shape, you need to eat right.

What is a healthy diet?

A healthy diet is more than eating a salad for lunch or buying fat-free yogurt. A healthy diet is a balanced diet that gives your body the nutrients it needs to function properly. And that means getting the majority of your daily calories from fresh fruits and vegetables, whole grains, legumes, nuts, and lean proteins.

When should you start?

Right now! No matter how old you are, how you've eaten in the past, whether you exercise daily or almost never, the benefits of a healthy diet begin today... if you start today!

Where can you find healthy food?

Healthy food is available almost everywhere. You just have to plan ahead. Almost all restaurants and grocery stores offer healthy options nowadays. And, although it may be more expensive than unhealthy food, the extra money you spend on buying healthy food will be repaid many times over from a healthy life.

What is Meditation?

Meditation is one path toward transforming the mind. Buddhist meditation practices encourage and develop concentration, clarity, and emotional positivity. When you begin a meditation practice, you may learn the patterns and habits of your mind. Meditation offers you a way to cultivate new and more positive ways to approach the things you do throughout your day. Meditation can have a transformative effect and can lead to positive changes as well as a new understanding of life.

How to prepare to Shape Up!

Get a check up
If you have any health issues or take any medications, be sure to consult with your healthcare provider before beginning a new exercise or diet regimen.

Dress for Success
Workout clothes should be comfy. While exercising, you should be thinking about what you're doing, not what you're wearing. That includes good shoes, which are essential for running, jogging, or walking, and socks that absorb shock and sweat.

Equipment?
You don't need to buy a lot of fancy equipment to get in shape. But you might want to invest in a yoga mat, a large exercise ball, or some weights, depending on your Shape Up! plan.

Resist Temptation
It's hard to eat right when everyone else is buying lunch at a fast food restaurant. Invest in some good food containers and bring your healthy lunch and snacks. Your body and your wallet will thank you.

Strength training

Strength training is a type of physical exercise that uses resistance to induce muscular contraction. This builds the strength, anaerobic endurance, and size of skeletal muscles.

Benefits

When properly performed, strength training can provide significant functional benefits and improvement in overall health and well-being. Some of the benefits are:

increased bone, muscle, tendon, and ligament strength and toughness
improved joint function
reduced potential for injury
increased bone density
increased metabolism
improved cardiac function

Exercises and sports

Training commonly uses the technique of progressively increasing the force output of the muscle through incremental weight increases. It uses a variety of exercises and types of equipment to target specific muscle groups.
Some sports where strength training is central are bodybuilding, weightlifting, shotput, discus throw, and javelin throw. Many other sports use strength training as part of their training regimen. These include tennis, American football, wrestling, track and field, rowing, lacrosse, basketball, hockey, wrestling, and soccer.

Stress Relief
		
We all encounter stress at one time or another. So it's important to be able to recognize stress and learn how to deal with it.

What is stress?

Stress is the feeling that people have when they are overloaded and struggling to cope with demands. Anything that poses a real or perceived challenge or threat to a person's well-being can cause stress.

Stress can also be a motivator. It can be essential to survival. The &quot;fight-or-flight&quot; mechanism helps us know when and how to respond to danger. But when this mechanism is triggered too easily, or when there are too many stressors at one time, it can become harmful to a person's mental and physical health.

How to manage your stress

To help manage stress, try the following:

Take a break from what you're doing
Exercise on a regular basis
Take time to smile and laugh
Get support from family and friends
Meditate

Stress relief tips

Here are five tips that can help you relieve stress on a daily basis.
            
Take a break from what you're doing

Maybe it's hard to get away from a big work project, a crying baby or a growing credit card bill. But give yourself permission to step away from it for a short time. Don't avoid your stressors (those bills have to be paid sometime), but take a few minutes for yourself.
            
Exercise on a regular basis

Exercise is a huge part of being healthy, and it benefits your mind as well as your body. It doesn't have to be an hour a day; even a 20-minute walk in the midst of a stressful time can give you an immediate effect that can last for several hours.

Take time to smile and laugh

When people are stressed, they often hold a lot of the stress in their face. Laughs and smiles can help relieve some of that tension and improve the situation. And if you share your smile with someone else, it will them release some of their tension too!

Get support from family and friends

Call a friend, send an email. Sharing your concerns does help relieve stress. But pick a person who you feel can understand you. If your co-workers are the stressors, it probably won't alleviate your stress if you share your worries over credit card bills with one of them.

Meditate

Meditation helps the mind and body to relax and focus. When meditating, people can release emotions that may have been causing the body physical stress. Research has shown that even meditating briefly can reap immediate benefits.

Mindfulness: The practice of vipassana

Vipassana is a quality of mind generally referred to as mindfulness. Mindfulness is a state of open and nonjudgmental attention to the contents of consciousness. Cultivating this quality of mind has been shown to moderate pain, relieve anxiety and depression, improve cognitive function.

It may sound easy to sit quietly and remove your mind of distraction, but when you begin practicing vipassana, you'll find that distraction is the normal condition of the mind. In today�s fast-paced world, it's harder than ever to train the mind to break through these continuous distractions. Meditation is a technique for doing just this. The goal is to enjoy a mind that is undisturbed by worry and to become effortlessly aware of the flow of experience in the present.

There is no time limit on meditation. You can start with a 5-minute meditation session once a month, spend an hour a day meditating, or anything in between. This is your practice, your journey, and you proceed at your pace. Regardless of how long or how often you practice vipassana, you will always receive its benefits.

How to begin practicing vipassana

Sit comfortably, with your spine erect, either in a chair or cross-legged on a cushion.
Close your eyes, take a few deep breaths, and feel the points of contact between your body and the chair or floor. Notice the sensations associated with sitting, such as feelings of pressure, warmth, tingling, or vibration.
Gradually become aware of the process of breathing. Pay attention to wherever you feel the breath most clearly�either at the nostrils or in the rising and falling your abdomen.
Allow your attention to rest in the mere sensation of breathing. Don�t try to control your breath. Just let it come and go naturally.
Every time your mind wanders in thought, gently return it to the sensation of breathing.
As you focus on your breathing, you will notice that other perceptions and sensations continue to appear: sounds, feelings in the body, emotions. Notice these phenomena as they come into your field of awareness, and then return to the sensation of breathing.
The moment you realize that you have been lost in thought, notice the present thought itself as an object of consciousness. Then return your attention to your breathing or to whatever sounds or sensations arise in the next moment.
Continue in this way until you can simply witness all objects of consciousness�sights, sounds, sensations, emotions, and even thoughts themselves�as they arise and pass away.
